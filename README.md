# Multidimensional-Scaling-of-Provincial-Employability-in-Spain
An exploratory study applying multidimensional scaling (MDS) to provincial employability indicators in Spain. It condenses high-dimensional metrics into low-dimensional representations to reveal regional patterns, province clusters, and interpretable underlying factors.

---

## Short abstract
This repository contains the data, analysis script and final report for an MDS-based exploratory study of provincial employability in Spain. The goal is to reduce high-dimensional employability indicators into 2–3 dimensions using classical multidimensional scaling (MDS), and to visualize regional patterns across Spanish provinces.

## What is inside the data
- `data/employment.RData` — An R workspace file expected to contain an R object named `employment` (a data frame or matrix with provincial indicators). The analysis script loads and uses this object directly.

## How to reproduce / usage

### Requirements
- R (recommended: R ≥ 4.0)
- R packages:
  - `StatMatch`
  - `scatterplot3d`
  - (base R packages; `cmdscale`, `dist`, `scale`, `cor`, `plot`, `text`, etc. are used)

Install missing packages in R with, for example:
```r
install.packages(c("StatMatch","scatterplot3d"))
```

### Run the analysis
Open an R session in the project root (the folder that contains `data/`, `src/`, `report/`) and run:

Interactive (R or RStudio):
```r
# from the project root
source("src/employment_mds.R")
```

Non-interactive (command-line):
```bash
Rscript src/employment_mds.R
```

**Note:** the script calls `windows()` to open a plotting device (this is Windows-specific). If you run on Linux/macOS or in headless mode, either:
- replace `windows()` with `X11()` (Linux) or `quartz()` (macOS), or
- comment out the `windows()` call and instead open a file device (e.g. `pdf("report/fig1.pdf")` ... `dev.off()`), or
- run the script inside RStudio which handles plotting windows cross-platform.

---

## What the script does (high level)
- Loads `employment` data from `data/employment.RData`.
- Produces descriptive summaries and basic plots (boxplots, histograms, barplots).
- Computes pairwise dissimilarities (e.g. using correlation/distance) and applies classical MDS (`cmdscale`) to extract two or three principal dimensions.
- Visualizes the MDS solution (2D and 3D), annotates provinces, and saves or displays the figures.
- The included `report/MEDAD_EmploymentMds.pdf` contains the final visualizations and interpretation.

---

## Files generated by the analysis
The repository already includes a PDF report at `report/MEDAD_EmploymentMds.pdf`. Running the script as provided will generate interactive plots and (depending on modifications you make for file devices) can export plots to files.

---

## Reproducibility tips & troubleshooting
- Verify that `employment.RData` loads an object named `employment`. You can check this in R:
```r
load("data/employment.RData")
ls()
head(employment)
```
- If `Rscript` fails due to plotting windows, modify the script to write plots to files (see note above).
- If package installation fails behind a proxy, set appropriate environment variables or install from a local binary.
